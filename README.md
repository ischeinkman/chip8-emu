# Chip8-emu

## Description

A simple Chip 8 emulator written in Rust. The goals are being simple,
straight-forward, and easy to understand instead of raw performance.
Documentation will include information about the Chip 8, the emulator's
structure, and other related pieces.

## Building and Running

To simply run the program without any special configuration:

1. Download ```SDL2``` and ```cargo``` and install them onto your computer. 

2. Download or ```git clone``` the codebase onto your computer.

3. ```cd``` into the project directory.

4. Run ```cargo run [path to rom]```.

To build an executable, run ```cargo build``` instead.

The number of instructions executed per second can be limited with the ```--fps [max number]``` runtime argument.

Different debug logs can be generated by enabling different features at compile time
with the ```--features="[features list]"``` flag:

* If ```log_frames``` is enabled, every time the screen is drawn the emulator will also write the screen buffer to ```stdout``` in bit form.

* If ```log_fps``` is enabled, after every instruction timing information will be written to ```stdout```.

* If ```log_level=error``` is enabled, error information will be logged to ```stderr```.

* If ```log_level=debug``` is enabled, all previous flags will be enabled and verbose instruction information will be printed to ```stdout``` after every instruction execution.
